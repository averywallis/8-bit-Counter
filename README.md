# 8-bit Counter
 A simple 8-bit Binary Counter powered by AA batteries

This project is a simple 8-bit counter using two 4-bit counter ICs. Powered by AA batteries and connected to LEDs, it visually displays counting up to 8-bits in binary. This works as a cool little visual display that can be displayed around the house or in a MakerSpace. It has no functional purpose, it is purely for display reasons only.
